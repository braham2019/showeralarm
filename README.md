# Shower alarm

I wanted to tackle two simple household issues in my bathroom:

- Make sure the (teenage) inhabitants don't shower longer than necessary
- Boost the Renson ventilation to extract moisture/steam quicker.

## How did I do this

The first issues is easy: install a bathroom timer that buzzes when time is up. 
The second one is do-able as the Renson ventilation has a local API that can be addressed to boost the ventilation to max.
