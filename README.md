# Shower alarm

I wanted to tackle two simple household issues in my bathroom:

1 Make sure the (teenage) inhabitants don't shower longer than necessary
2 Boost the Renson ventilation to extract moisture/steam quicker.
  
The first issues is easy: install a bathroom timer that buzzes when time is up. The second one is do-able as the Renson ventilation has a local API that can be addressed to boost the ventilation to max.
